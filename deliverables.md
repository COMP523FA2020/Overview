One goal of the Avian Database Project is to aggregate all information related to a bird’s diet. The project offers users the flexibility to query the data with varying criteria. The first target audience of this project are scientists or researchers who wish to gather that information. For example, if a researcher wants to know how a specific bird’s diet will change from season to season, he is able to use the website’s filters to find out. This website can become the central place that researchers can go to when trying to query the diet database of birds.

To help researchers access the appropriate data, we will implement many different filters and criteria that will affect their results. The user can modify the results by region, season, time, and species categories. Furthermore, there are graphs near the query results that summarizes the main information. Those graphs can help the researcher visually understand the data trends better and can also be a tool that the researchers could use in their future presentations.

Another target audience for this project are the general public who are curious about bird diets and wish to explore more. The website can bring more public interest to wildlife and the environment. Currently, there lacks a concentrate database where any individual can look up what different birds eat, so this project fulfills that need. We hope to make this website new-user friendly by having different query options. If the user already has a bird in mind, he can type in the bird to learn about its diet. However, if the user doesn’t have a particular bird that he wants to look up, he can also query the database by prey. Another aspect that promotes new-user friendliness is the autocomplete option in the search bar. A person visiting the website can start typing in any bird’s name, and the autocomplete will suggest a whole array of options for the user to explore

The project that I have been developing with my group is a bird diet database. Prior to the creation of this database, there has never been an accumulation of this data on this scale before. In said database, there are archived studies (tracing back decades). Our app will provide researchers with access to this data in a user-friendly way. From this data, researchers might find insights into how bird’s diets have changed over the years. From the categorization of this data, there may be inferences that can be made about the effects that climate change, habitat destruction, and human industrialization/development have had on the health of ecosystems around North America.

Our team on the Avian Diet Database project aims to fulfill Professor Hurlburt’s need of allowing common internet users access to his team’s database of avian diets. This database is a collective of information from many different sources compiled by Hurlburt, his team, and other contributors. Since this is a compilation from many different sources, the information it contains is vast and could be extremely helpful for scientist observing trends relating to avian diet over the years. However, it requires technical knowledge in R programming to be able to query information from the data. We fulfil the need of allowing untechnical users access to the database by providing a website with a search bar that gives users ability to search through the database in a similar manner as common search sites (e.g. Google, Bing, etc). Aside from giving everyone easy access to the database, Professor Hurlburt plans on publishing a paper relating to his database. The site would give readers of his paper or those interested and easy way to look at the work he has done.
